How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
OB
    It made it much easier to see just the differences between the two
    instead of having to compare line by line manually to find the difference

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    This would help a lot specially when a program crashes after changing some code, I can go back to the history and see what caused the program to crash

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: 1- Flexibitly, because I get to choose what and when to commit
    	  2- Ensures code correctness, because I commit only when there is a		    logical change in the code
    cons: 1- Must remember to commit after every logical change

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

      Probably because Git deals with code but other version control systems can deal with different types of documents to save    

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I can use git log to see the messages associated with each commit, and I can you use git diff to see the changes between the different commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

      I think it will make me much more confident knowing that I can revert back to a previous commit in case something really bad happens

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to use it to set up my own repository and start pushing and pulling code to and from it
