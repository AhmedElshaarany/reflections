When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  I think this would be really helpful if I am wokring on the repository from multiple places, like for example from my Desktop 
  computer at work, and also my personal laptop at home

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because the remote repository might not be the most updated version, I could for example be working on the repository on another computer, and the remote won't have that version until I push it. Therefore, it woule be best if I manually pulled changes.
