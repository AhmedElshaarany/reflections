When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  I think this would be really helpful if I am wokring on the repository from multiple places, like for example from my Desktop 
  computer at work, and also my personal laptop at home

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because the remote repository might not be the most updated version, I could for example be working on the repository on another computer, and the remote won't have that version until I push it. Therefore, it woule be best if I manually pulled changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  forks: are special clones used by GitHub to be able to clone someone's else repository with to your own profile, and still reference that this is a copy of someone else's repository, you can then modify, pull, and add to this repository as you see fit

  clones: They are copies of either remote repositories or local repositories

  branches: They are modifications of previous commits which may or may not be added to the master branch, they are usually used for experimentation
