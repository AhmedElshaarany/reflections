What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    a .git directory gets created, this directory is going to be the git repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    The working directory contains all files, while the staging area contains only the files that are tracked by the git repository.
I think this is good way to determine which files I need to track, and which files that I don't want to add to the repository
